<img src="lyney1.jpg" height=170 width=200 border=6 align=left alt=Lyney>
<font face=Fantasy color=black size=5>
<abbr title="Full name - Lyney">
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InFM4OvLbxk">Lyney</a>
</abbr>
<font face=Tahoma size=3 color=#004969><br>
<b><i>Lyney, a character in the game "Genshin Impact", a talented magician famous in Fontaine.He claiming to be "The Best Magician in all of Teyvat",touching the hearts of the audience with exquisite techniques and words.Sharp-tongued, superb acting skills, and as hard to guess as a cat's thoughts.
<br>
It is because he is a new character, there is very little description of him in the game. We have just met him in the game, but Lyney’s life-threatening accident occurred during a surprising magic show, which led to an unsolved case from many years ago. I was attracted by the excitement of the story, and I am a big fan of "Detective Conan". Naturally, I was curious about Lyney’s identity, and because of his personality, I fell in love with this character.
